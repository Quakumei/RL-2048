# RL-2048
Pet project to explore Reinforcement Learning (RL) capabilities in 2048 game 

## TODO list:
MVP 0:
1. [ ] Code a simple environment (game with capabilities of allowing a random agent play it). Properties: 4x4, max number - 2048.
2. [ ] Code a Reinforcement Learning algorithm and train an agent.
3. [ ] Compare steps count to win with the research paper on Markov in 2048.
4. [ ] Deploy model to docker container and create site to show your research and host it in demonstration purposes. (don't forget about markdown to html).

Scaling:
- [ ] Code a pipiline to train an agent on different grid sizes
- [ ] Experiment with different grid sizes 
- [ ] Experiment with maximum tile value 
- [ ] Figure out a universal agent (refer to google chip ai) 
- [ ] Experiment with transfer learning between grid sizes
