# RL-2048

Pet project to explore Reinforcement Learning (RL) capabilities in 2048 game

## TODO list

MVP 0:

1. [ ] Code a simple environment (game with capabilities of allowing a random agent play it). Properties: 4x4, max number - 2048.
2. [ ] Code a Reinforcement Learning algorithm and train an agent.
3. [ ] Compare steps count to win with the research paper on Markov in 2048.
4. [ ] Deploy model to docker container and create site to show your research and host it in demonstration purposes. (don't forget about markdown to html).

Scaling:

- [ ] Code a pipiline to train an agent on different grid sizes
- [ ] Experiment with different grid sizes
- [ ] Experiment with maximum tile value
- [ ] Figure out a universal agent (refer to google chip ai)
- [ ] Try checking transfer learning effect on learning rate
- [ ] Play with tile_proba
- [ ] Move to a more complex environment (2048 with 5x5 grid, 4096 with 4x4 grid, etc.)
- [ ] Move game to higher dimensions (3D, 4D, etc.)
